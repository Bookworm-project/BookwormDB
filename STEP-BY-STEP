1. Install github on your system.

2. Fork the project bmschmidt/presidio.

3. Set up, in the directory "presidio" inside the folder  a new git repository with your fork as the origin. (You can add the main branch as a remote later, so that changes can be merged back in).

4. Create all the files required by the README. (with which this document should eventually be merged).
