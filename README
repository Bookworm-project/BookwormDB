This is the code repository for BUILDING the databases we're working with on Bookworm.The Bookworm project is a separate github 
directory at Bookworm. That project is for the bookworm web site, which lives in a single directory on the web server; this project gathers together the various snippets of code that we'll need to run on many different computers.

Much of this code is going to rely on directory structures that may only exist on certain machines. In general, I think we will assume access to the following directories, with filepaths relative to /presidio:

1) ../raw. This is where the actual texts are going to live, all at the same depth. (This can be big--about a million files in a single directory is pretty common.

2) ../metadata. This is where we'll store information like filenames, wordid lookup tables, and 
logs that we don't want pushed to git.

3) A MySQL database. 

4) Other folders will be created by the code.

The general workflow is:

1) write a metadata parser and, if needed, a text downloader that fills the /raw and /metadata files with appropriately formatted information.

2) Run "ImportNewLibrary.py", which calls master.py a bunch of times and creates the necessary word files and encodes, if requested. (This works primarily by calling master.py a bunch of times).

3) Run "NevaPy.py" or "Bens Python Functions.py" or something else that loads the information into a database. Currently, this still requires a bit too much custom specification for each database.

4) Set up a bookworm installation with the Bookworm code.
