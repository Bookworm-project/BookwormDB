This is the code repository for BUILDING the databases we're working with on Bookworm. The Bookworm project is a separate github 
directory at mcamac/Bookworm. That project is for the bookworm web site, which lives in a single directory on the web server; this 
project gathers together the various snippets of code that we'll need to run on many different computers.

Much of this code is going to rely on directory structures that may only exist on certain machines. In general, I think we will 
assume access to the following directories, with filepaths relative to /Presidio:

1) ../books. This is where the actual texts are going to live; subdirectories may carry different variations of them.

2) ../metadata. (On Wumpus, currently at ../code) This is where we'll store information like filenames, wordid lookup tables, and 
logs that we don't want pushed to git.

3) A MySQL database.
