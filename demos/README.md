This folder provides a few scripts (possibly obsolete) that show how to do various things using bookworm and the Bookworm API. Ideally all contributions will be things that take some kind of literature programming form: R Studio notebooks or ipython notebooks.

This is *not* for setup instructions, but more arcane stuff.

Contributions welcome.
